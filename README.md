# texrender
Render a sample of a PBR texture using Blender.

Rough usage:

```
texrender -o preview.png some_texture_directory/*.png
```

Partially based on the node wrangler PBR texture importer (thanks, guys!). Probably has a lot of bugs and even more missing features. Bug reports and patches welcome.
